<p class="lead">That's right, people still run Minecraft servers.</p>

The NerdCubed Minecraft server is back! This time, it's run by the fans, for the fans. A Minecraft server with worlds such as:

* **Survival** (PvE): A community-focused PvE Survival world, with a few useful extras such as /homes and inter-player messaging. 
* ~~**Creative**: A classic, open creative world. No plot system, just a flat open world.~~ Coming soon!
* ~~**Plots (new!)**: A recently introduced plot world! Claim a plot and build away without worry!~~ Coming soon!

The Minecraft server is integrated with Discord: chat with in-game players from your Discord app without opening Minecraft! We also occasionally host community events!
