That's right, people still run Minecraft servers.

We have a community and PvE-focused **Survival world**, with a few useful extras such as /homes and inter-player messaging.

The Minecraft server is integrated with Discord: chat with in-game players from your Discord app without opening Minecraft! We also occasionally host community events!

## Server details

*Please take the time to read* the [rules and guidelines](/help/minecraft-guidelines) before joining. This is a community-focused server. Unprovoked PvP, griefing, or looting is not allowed. 

**Server address**: `mc.n3fs.co.uk`  
**Minecraft version**: Java Edition 1.19.4

Please feel free to join the server to have a look around!

To be able to interact and build, you need to verify that you have read and will comply with our rules.
