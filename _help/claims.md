~~You may request to claim a build if the owner has been inactive for more than a month.~~

***Claims are currently suspended starting 1 August 2018.*** From now on, players will not be able to claim old builds except for in very exceptional circumstances. While we understand this may be frustrating for some, we've made this decision in the best interests of the survival server, to prevent old builds being lost to time as players move on.
