You may submit a ban appeal here, but before you do so, *please note the following points*. 

----

Please take a look through our [rules](/rules) again so you know what's expected of you. 

Bans are not a punishment: instead, they're a way for us to enforce the server rules so everyone has an enjoyable time here. Being open and honest, and taking responsibility for your actions will help with your appeal.

If you're able to, join the [N3FS Discord](/discord). This makes it easier to communicate the outcome of your appeal with you.
