We've laid down some rules we expect all players and users of N3FS to follow. For the avoidance of doubt, all rules are upheld at staff's discretion.

## Rules

### General

These rules apply everywhere:

* **Do not be offensive.** Racism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia and other forms of toxicity and hate speech are not tolerated. NSFW/inappropriate content is similarly not welcome.
* **Do not annoy others**. Remain civil and polite. Avoid conflicts, and work to resolve them should any arise.
* **Do not attempt to break anything or bypass permissions.** If you spot an issue, please report it to a member of staff.
* **Do not advertise or spam.** 
* **Do not use hacks, mods, or other tools to gain an advantage over others.** Please play fair.
* **Do not backseat moderate.** Please contact a member of staff if help is needed.
* **Follow staff instructions.** If a staff member asks you to stop, please comply. 

### Minecraft

* **Do not grief or loot. No unprovoked PvP.** This is a community-focused server, and players expect others to behave accordingly. 
* **Respect the property owner's wishes.** Do not bypass locked doors, and do not modify or take someone elses' property without permission. Doing so is considered griefing.
* **Do not make unnessesarily large land claims.** If you have plans for a really grand project, please move further away from towns and other players.
* **Permitted and unpermitted mods:** Mods that affect gameplay and give you an advantage are not allowed. 
    * Optimisation mods like OptiFine are okay. 
    * Examples of mods that are not allowed: ore finders, x-ray, or minimap mods that show player locations.
