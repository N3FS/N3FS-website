Today's build showcase features builds by our most recently appointed builder, Reeperlord!

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/images/showcase/reeperlord/" %}

These builds were all planned in creative but were fully built in survival!

## Build showcase? What's all this about?

To highlight the effort that goes into builds on the server, we've decided to start a regular feature where we showcase exceptional builds from players. We're always looking to showcase more builds, so if you see any exceptional builds that deserve a place on the build showcase, let us know in **#server-discussion** on Discord or fill out the [builder nomination form](/help/builder)!
