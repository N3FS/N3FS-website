To design the new town hall in Dan Francisco, we will be holding a build competition!

<!-- more -->

The competition will start on Friday 13th September at 8PM BST and will finish at 8PM BST on Sunday 15th so you'll have almost all of next weekend to build.

More details will be posted on [Discord](/discord) in **#announcements** closer to the start date.
