title: The Minecraft 1.13 server is here! (and about our 1.12 shutdown plans)
---

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We've soft-launched the Minecraft 1.13 server, and it's now open to all users! You might also notice our fancy new website. 

Along with this, there are some incoming change to both the new and old game servers.

## New server launch

[The Minecraft 1.13 Minecraft server](/minecraft) is now live, and reachable at the usual server address of **mc.n3fs.co.uk**. 

At the moment, we only have the Hub and Survival worlds available. The new server is completely rebuilt from scratch, so we're taking things slowly and making sure everything is working well. Creative will be added soon, once we're all settled in. 

(P.S. you should [join our Discord server](/discord), we might have a launch party...)

## Old server shutdown plans

With this comes the impending shutdown of our old Minecraft 1.12 server. ðŸ˜¢

***We expect to shut down the old server on or after 19 May 2019.*** The old server will remain accessible until then at **legacy.n3fs.co.uk**. 

We intend to release the world files after the shutdown, but we will not be releasing player data (which would contain information like your spawn points, homes, and inventories). 

Please take note of the following:

* Please complete any builds, and report any griefing or damage that needs to be fixed before the shutdown! 
* Save all important items in to normal chests if you want to retrieve them. This includes your player inventory and Ender Chest contents. 
* Also, do note down your /home coordinates so you can TP to those locations.
