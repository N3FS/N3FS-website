<p class="lead">N3FS is now hosting a Just Cause 3 Multiplayer sandbox server!</p>

<!--more-->

Fly, grapple, and shoot your way through Medici in game! Here's what's new:

* **A sandbox server**: spawn in vehicles and weapons and cause as much chaos as you like!
* **Discord integration:** join in the chat in #jc3mp even if you're not playing!
* **Associated website updates**: We added real-time server details for the server. Apart from that, we'll leave you to figure out what else is new! ;)

### Connecting to the server

You will need Just Cause 3 on Steam, along with the [JC3:MP client](https://just-cause.mp/downloads) to connect. We're listed on the server list, so just launch the client, and connect with the in-game server browser.

If you encounter any issues, please drop us a note on Discord in #issues. Please try not to break everything.
