title: Old Minecraft world downloads
author: Joey

As promised, here are some of the world downloads for the previous Minecraft server which just shut down. 

<!--more-->

These files are being provided as-is from the server, so each world dimension is in its own folder (for worlds like Survival). 

If you load them in vanilla Minecraft, you will spawn in Survival mode. You will need to move some folders around so the Overworld, Nether, and The End dimensions work properly in singleplayer. 

If you want to keep it easy, just pop each folder into your .minecraft/saves folder. To change game mode, go to the Pause menu, and select Open to LAN. set Allow Cheats to On, open the world, then type in the command `/gamemode creative`.
