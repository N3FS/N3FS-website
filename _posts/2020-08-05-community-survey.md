## When's 1.16 coming?

As you may have noticed, a month ago we enabled connecting to the server from 1.16.1, and creative has been updated to 1.16.1. Due to upcoming technical changes
in 1.16.2, we're hoping to update survival once Mojang has released 1.16.2. We'll let you know closer to the time when we have a timeline for the 1.16.2 upgrade.
